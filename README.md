# Denostories

A Storybook implementation for the [Fresh framework](https://fresh.deno.dev/). Heavily inspired by [Ladle](https://ladle.dev/).

Denostories will also _automatically_ render each story to give you live feedback and interrupt deploys when something goes wrong.

## Getting started

1. Add Denostories to your project

1. Inject storybook routes

1. Add headless checks to your build process

1. Create a story!
